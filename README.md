Multi-Modal Language-Driven Image Generation System

Overview : 

This project aims to create an advanced AI system capable of generating high-quality images based on natural language prompts. By incorporating multi-modal capabilities, the system will allow for refined outputs using a combination of textual and image inputs.

Objectives : 

Develop an AI pipeline integrating a transformer-based language model with a generative adversarial network (GAN) or diffusion-based model for image generation.

Enable multi-modal support to enhance image generation using both text and reference images.

Provide a web-based interface for user interaction.

Document the entire process, including model training, datasets used, and challenges encountered.

Include semantic segmentation techniques to allow for fine-tuned control over individual image elements.

Deliverables  :
